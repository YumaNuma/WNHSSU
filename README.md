# Event System for Stage Crews
  This system allows Crew Chief to create an event, allow Crew Members to sign up for events, and see an up-to-date list of events all from a mobile device or PC!
  The frontend is semi-mobile friendly, but all features 100% work on both mobile and PC.

## Backstory:
  I made this system cause I was going crazy not knowing what events there were or who was working them or if someone was already working them. So I just decided to make my own system and hopefully have it implemented into the stage crew. This was developed by me, Zaid, through tears and my last remaining brain cells right after finals week. This could use a bit of refactoring, which I will attempt my best to do. I welcome contributors cause I am far from perfect and anyone is welcome to download this and use it for their own school or whatever.
